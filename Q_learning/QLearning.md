# Q-Learning Algorithm Explanation and Demonstration

This repository contains an implementation of the Q-learning algorithm applied to solve a reinforcement learning problem. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique used to find an optimal action-selection policy for any given finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this demonstration, we apply Q-learning to train an agent to solve a simple environment.

## Q-Learning Overview

Q-learning involves learning an action-value function Q(s, a), where:
- \( Q(s, a) \) represents the expected cumulative reward when taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).

### Key Concepts

- **Q-table**: The Q-table is a data structure where each entry Q(s, a) represents the learned value of taking action \( a \) in state \( s \). Initially, Q-values are initialized arbitrarily or to zeros. During training, Q-values are updated iteratively based on the agent's interactions with the environment.

- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**: To balance exploration and exploitation, the agent uses an epsilon-greedy policy:
  - With probability \( \epsilon \), the agent selects a random action (exploration).
  - With probability \( 1 - \epsilon \), the agent selects the action with the highest Q-value for the current state (exploitation).

- **Parameters**:
  - **Alpha (\( \alpha \))**: Learning rate that determines how much new information overrides old information during Q-value updates.
  - **Gamma (\( \gamma \))**: Discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate rewards.
  - **Epsilon (\( \epsilon \))**: Exploration-exploitation trade-off parameter controlling the rate of random action selection versus exploitation of learned Q-values.
